# Artificial-Itellegience-n_rooks_queens
* Implementation of N-Queens and N-Rooks problem using Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithms.
* Solution for N-Rooks problem includes finding steps to place N rooks so that no two of them are in the same row or column.
* Solution for N-Queens problem includes finding steps to place N queens such that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Running the program
python nrooks.py
