## n-k-coh-coh game description: 
n-k-coh-coh is a popular childhood game in a certain rural midwestern town that requires just a board consisting of a grid of n X n squares and some white and black marbles. Initially the board starts emptyand all marbles are in a pile beside the board. Player 1 picks up a white marble and places it in any squareof the board. Player 2 then picks up a black marble from the pile, and places it in any open square (i.e.any square except the one selected by Player 1). Play continues back and forth, with Player 1 always usingwhite marbles and Player 2 always using black. A player loses the game as soon as they place a marble suchthat there is a continuous line of k marbles of his or her color in the same row, column, or diagonal of theboard. (For example, note that 3-3-coh-coh is nearly the same as tic-tac-toe, except that players are tryingto avoid completing a row, column or diagonal instead of trying to complete one.)
